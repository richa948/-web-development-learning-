## 🌟 Day 05 - CSS Loader Animation

### 🎯 What I Built
A simple **CSS spinning loader** created using border styling and CSS animations.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to create circular loaders using `border-radius`.
- Using `border` and `border-top` to create a rotating ring effect.
- Applying `@keyframes` and `animation` for continuous rotation.

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Try changing colors, size, or speed.
- Add gradient or shadow effects.
- Experiment with different shapes.
